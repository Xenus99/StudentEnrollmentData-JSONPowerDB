# StudentEnrollmentData-JSONPowerDB
This is a Micro-Project created using html, js and JSONPowerDB. It is a small demonstration about how JSONPowerDB works. This project consists of a form for student enrollment. It contains fields like Roll No, Name, Class, Birth-Date, Enrollment-Date and Address. There are three buttons with the functionalities Save, Change and Reset to interact with the form. This data is stored in the JSONPowerDB database server with the token no. provided to us. This data can also be retrieved by entering the Roll No.(Primary Key) of an already regestered student. One isn't allowed to enter data with the same Roll no which is already registered.
## Benefits of JSONPowerDB
1. Easy to use
